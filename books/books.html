		<img src = "IllustratedMan.jpg" alt = "The book cover of The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury. It shows a white hand with a spiral in it on a blue background." height = "200"/>
		<h2><a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24830.The_Illustrated_Man">The Illustrated Man</a></h2>
		<h4>by Ray Bradbury</h4>
		<p>"In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story"</p>

		<img src = "circe.jpg" alt = "The book cover of Circe by Madeline Miller. It shows a womens face in a copper color on a black background." height = "200"/>
		<h2><a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35959740-circe">Circe</h2></a>
		<h4>by Madelline Miller</h4>
		<p>"In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child--neither powerful like her father nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power: the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves."</p>

		<img src = "DorianGray.jpg" alt = "The book cover of The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. It shows a man leaning to one side in black and white, with a white circle obscuring part of his face." height = "200"/>
		<h2><a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5297.The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a></h2>
		<h4>by Oscar Wilde</h4>
		<p>"Combining elements of the Gothic horror novel and decadent French fiction, the book centers on a striking premise: As Dorian Gray sinks into a life of crime and gross sensuality, his body retains perfect youth and vigor while his recently painted portrait grows day by day into a hideous record of evil, which he must keep hidden from the world." </p>

			<!---Book 4-->
		<img src = "TheRoad.jpg" alt = "The book cover for The Road by Cormac McCarthy. It shows a the text: 'The Road' in red letters on a black background." height = "200"/>
		<h2><a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6288.The_Road">The Road</a></h2>
		<h4>by Cormac McCarthy</h4>
		<p>"A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don't know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged foodâ€”and each other."</p>
