The second shows a robot jumping from a blue circular portal to a orange one. The third shows a grassy field with sheep, and a logo above it with a person and dragon. The fourth shows a man with a mustache flying in space with a star behind him and planets in the distance. The fifth shows a man with a gun in a dark forest."/><h3>The Last of Us  |  Portal 2  |  Fantasy Life  |  Super Mario Galaxy  |  Uncharted 4</h3>
